#### **SkillSwap – Skill Exchange Platform (MERN Stack)** 



SkillSwap is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that enables users to exchange skills with each other instead of traditional monetary transactions.



The platform is designed to connect people who want to learn a skill with those who are willing to teach, promoting collaborative learning and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.

###### **Tech Stack**

**Frontend**



* React.js
* Context API / State Management
* Responsive UI



**Backend**



* Node.js
* Express.js
* RESTful APIs



**Database**



* MongoDB Atlas
* Mongoose ODM



**Cloud \& Deployment**

##### **Key Features**



🔹 Skill Exchange System

Users can offer skills they know and request skills they want to learn.



🔹 User Profiles \& Skill Listings

Each user maintains a profile showcasing their skills, interests, and availability.



🔹 Skill Matching Logic

Matches users based on complementary skill requirements (learn ↔ teach).



🔹 Request \& Approval Flow

Users can send, accept, or reject skill exchange requests.



🔹 Secure Authentication

User authentication and access control for skill interactions.



🔹 Modern \& Responsive UI

Clean, user-friendly interface accessible across devices.



##### **System Architecture**



* Frontend (React) handles user interaction, skill browsing, and request management.
* Backend (Express + Node.js) exposes REST APIs for users, skills, and exchange requests.
* MongoDB stores user profiles, skills, and exchange relationships.
* Cloudinary manages profile images and media efficiently.
* The application is deployed on Render with environment-based configurations.

##### **Engineering Challenges \& WOW Points** 



* &nbsp;Designed a real-world skill-exchange workflow instead of a simple CRUD app.
* &nbsp;Implemented bi-directional matching logic between learners and mentors.
* &nbsp;Structured MongoDB schemas to efficiently handle users, skills, and requests.
* &nbsp;Deployed a full-stack MERN application with proper environment separation.
* &nbsp;Gained experience in product thinking, not just coding — focusing on user interaction flow
